I wrote an Obsidian plugin that allows you to hide text behind other text. 

If you click on the "hyperlink" it copies it to your clipboard.

For example when trying to understand a large codebase, it's nice to be able to jot down where an important file lies (and be able to easily copy it for later use).

Here is the [repo](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin). The plugin has not yet been added to Obsidian community plugins (pending review).
