I wrote an Obsidian plugin that allows you to hide text behind other text.

For example when trying to understand a large codebase, it's nice to be able to jot down where an important file lies (and be able to easily copy it for later use).

Here is the [repo](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).
