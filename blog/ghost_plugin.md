I wrote an Obsidian plugin called "Ghost Text" that allows you to hide text behind other text. 

If you click on the "hyperlink" it copies it to your clipboard.

For example when trying to understand a large codebase, it's nice to be able to jot down where an important file lies (and be able to easily copy it for later use).

It's an official community plugin and can be installed from the Obsidian community plugins!
