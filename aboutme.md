Hi, I'm Lawrence Feng! I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Statistics and Machine Learning. I have a broad interest in the field of machine learning, including language models, diffusion, reinforcement learning, and safety, and I'm working to both increase the breadth and depth of my intuition, knowledge, and fascination of this deeply transformative field.

But more generally, I'm interesting in probing whatever all *this* is. 

Since the beginning of humankind, we have looked up at the stars and wondered. How in the universe did we end up here? Somehow, at this moment in time, on this particular rock (of the Goldilocks temperature), we managed to evolve into a part of the universe that is aware of itself (that characterizes the temperature of its whereabouts using a *fairy tale* about a family of anthropomorphized bears who enjoy a nice bowl of porrdige).  

Oh, but what is the purpose in understanding ourselves and the universe philosophically? Exactly! We are purpose-seeking creatures. We crave to find direction in our lives. We craft our lives into narratives and our narratives shape our lives. Purpose gives us a reason to live and purpose . In some sense, there is no bigger, no grander perspective that can be had than the perspective that the universe gives to us. The universe is everything. It is *the* perspective. It is so easy to get wrapped up in our daily lives, in our earthly pleasures, but the cosmic perspective challenges that. Reconciling these two perspectives is unavoidable to me, it is a requirement for the continuation life. Once you know about the birth and eventual heat death of our universe, how could you ever go back? To find true meaning, true understanding, of ourselves, my oh-so human innate pursuit of knowledge and desire to resolve the contradictions of life tells me that contemplating everything and the universe is a necessary condition. 

But why artificial intelligence? On the perspective line, the study of artifical intelligence seems to be in the completely opposition direction the pursuit of a cosmic understanding of ourselves, but I don't think our line is quite straight here. There are deep ethical and philosophical questions that come from our pursuit of AI. By some measures, we already have models that surpass the intelligence of the average human, yet somehow we don't have autonomous cars. Somehow, the SOTA language models can write sophistcated, factually-dense prose, yet they cannot perform six-digit by six-digit multiplication. Somehow, these same language models can write deeply intricate, introspectives paragraphs about intelligence and sentience, yet most of our intuitions tell us that these artifical intelligences are not self-aware. As build the future of intelligence on this planet, we must ask ourselves, for technical, ethical, and philosophical reasons, what intellignece, understanding, learning, and sentience really mean. As we dive deep into the workings of our brains, and replciate them, and develop architectures that are increasingly different from ourselves, our understanding of how we work is profoundly challenged. In the same sense that learning more about our universe may shape why and how we live, learning more about our intelligence may shape why and how we live. And that's why I find artifical intelligence so fascinating.
