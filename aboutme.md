Hi, I'm Lawrence Feng! I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Statistics and Machine Learning. I have a broad interest in the field of machine learning, including language models, diffusion, reinforcement learning, and safety, and I'm working to both increase the breadth and depth of my intuition, knowledge, and fascination of this deeply transformative field.

But more generally, I'm interesting in probing whatever all *this* is. 

Since the beginning of humankind, we have looked up at the stars and wondered. How in the universe did we end up here? Somehow, at this moment in time, on this particular rock (of the Goldilocks temperature), we managed to evolve into a part of the universe that is aware of itself (that characterizes the temperature of its whereabouts using a *fairy tale* about a family of anthropomorphized bears who enjoy a nice bowl of porrdige).  

Oh, but what is the purpose in understanding ourselves and the universe philosophically? Exactly! We are purpose-seeking creatures. We crave to find direction in our lives. We craft our lives into narratives and our narratives shape our lives. Purpose gives us a reason to live. In some sense, there is no bigger, grander perspective that can be had than the universe. The universe is everything. It is *the* perspective.
