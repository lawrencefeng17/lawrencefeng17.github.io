I need to sit down and actually write an about me...






My name is Lawrence Feng. I'm a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Statistics and Machine Learning. I have a broad interest in the field of machine learning, including language models, diffusion, reinforcement learning, and safety, and I'm working to both increase the breadth and depth of my intuition, knowledge, and fascination of this deeply transformative field.

More generally, I'm interesting in probing whatever all this is........
