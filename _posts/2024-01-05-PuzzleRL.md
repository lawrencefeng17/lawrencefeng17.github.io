## Inspiration

This project began from a desire to meld reinforcement learning with image manipulation. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can perform position-invariant classification (i.e. a CNN can identify a flower in an image no matter where the flower is in the image).

But what if we wanted to perform a different sort of *something*-invariant classification. For example classification invariant under corruption, scrambling, etc. We want to be able to dynamically extract features from an image under variation so that we are still able to perform classification. This area of research is called dynamic feature selection or active feature aquisition.

## What we actually did

Unfortunately, due to limited experience with reinforcement learning and limited time, we settled for a simpler reinformcent learning problem. 

We trained a reinforcement learning agent to perform image reassembly on scrambled jigsaw puzzles of the MNIST dataset. 

We took MNIST images and created 3x3 jigsaw puzzles out of them. We framed this jigsaw game as a sequentially swapping game, where each move invovled swapping one tile with another. We wanted the agent to place the puzzles pieces in their original pieces in the least number of moves.

## Architecture and Pipeline

We were inspired by AlphaZero's architecture. 

We trained a value network with a CNN backbone to take in a jigsaw puzzle at some point in the reassembly process and output a scalar from 0 to 1 labeling how close it was to being reassembled.

We trained a policy network with a CNN backbone to take in a jigsaw puzzle at some point in tbe reassembly process and output a set of action-probability pairs (action referring to a valid move/swap).

Then we performed Monte Carlo Tree Search with PUCT that used the value network and the policy network in combination to perform depth reduction and breadth reduction, respectively.
