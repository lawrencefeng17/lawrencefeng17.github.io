> *Lady Bird* is a poignant and awkwardly comedic bildungsroman about a rambunctious 17 year old daughter and her tempestuous relationship with her loving mother, all wrapped into a love letter to the city of Sacramento

I haven't watched a movie in a while[^1]. I should really watch more movies.

Christine (played by Saoirse Ronan) has declared herself to be known as Lady Bird, triumphing over the name given to her by her parents. It's a creative motif that  tracks her transition from edgy seventeen year old to less edgy eighteen year old.

Christine doesn't quite know who she wants to be or where she wants to go, but she certainly knows it's not with her parents (who live on the "wrong side of the tracks") and not in Sacramento. *Lady Bird* so precisely reminds me of that feeling of *not wanting* while not having any semblance of what it is I do want. The intense repulsion for what you have now in favor of whatever it is I could have. This certainly described[^2] me when I was in high school. I wouldn't say the sentiment is "grass is greener on the other side." It's a lot more instinctive than that. It's a primal impatience for the ticking of the clock, a basal negativity for the present state. And oh my is it a terrible feeling.

As Lady Bird smokes her first cigarettes with her goth pseudo-sister, leaves behind her childhood best friend for the popular girl, pursues a hot dude named Kyle (played by Timoth√©e Chalamet, of course), and skips Thanksgiving with her family, she eventually comes to realize who in her life really cares about her. While not the most original plot, *Lady Bird* is written cleverly and executed beautifully. The side characters are purposeful and the dialogue strikes a sophisticated balance between awkward humor and intense emotional honesty.

Nearing the end of the film, Lady Bird finds out she got off the waitlist to attend college in New York City, even though she had been accepted into a far more affordable Sacramento-area college (*ahem* UC Davis[^3]). She went behind her mother's back to apply to East Coast colleges, leaving her mother feeling betrayed. She's also betrayed her childhood best friend, but comes to the realization her new popular girl friend and douchebag (boy)friend Kyle are not what her life is about. She instead spends prom with her best friend (*cut to montage*).

Finally, Lady Bird arrives in New York, her dreams come true. She's far from her friends, her mother, her father, her brother, her home that is Sacramento. She's away from the house "on the wrong side of the tracks." In these moments of freedom, she finally comes to terms with the fact that her name is really Christine, and that it's a wonderful thing to be named by your parents. In these moments in a new city, Christine finally acknowledges the beauty in the ordinariness of her home of Sacramento.
