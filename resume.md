### Experience
---
**Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute** \| _Feb. 2024 - Present_ \| _Research Intern_
* Robot control models struggle to generalize in complex, multi-task settings
* How can we enable real-world understanding, reasoning, and generalization?
* We focus on trajectory-based, generative policy pipelines, such as those that utilize point tracking or optical flow
* Creating new and utilizing existing benchmarks to test the robustness of trajectory-based approaches

**Carnegie AI Safety Initiative (CASI)** \| _March 2024 - Present_ \| 
* Active member of the AI safety reading group
* Widening my philosophical, ethical, and technical perspectives on AI safety
* Analyzing and debating the latest research in areas such as alignment, interpretability, and explainability 

**Program on AI and Reasoning (PAIR 2024)** \| _August 2024_ \|
* Camp on artificial intelligence and rationality held by FABRIC

**UC Berkeley ATDP and Monte Vista** \| _August 2020 - August 2022_ \| _Teaching Assistant_
* Acted as the lead teaching assistant for courses in Python and Java
* Developed the curriculum, and helped make and modify assignments to facilitate learning
* Automated evaluation of programming submissions using unit testing
* Streamlined the grading process by using APIs to integrate learning management systems

**Boston University RISE** \| _June 2021 - August 2021_ \| _Research Intern_
* Designed an LSTM cache prefetcher to speed up common computationally intensive tasks
* Applied domain knowledge of computer system design and microarchitecture to a machine-learning task
* Results showed more than a 50% increase in performance compared to no prefetcher in some applications

### Projects
---
**Solving Jigsaw Puzzles using RL, inspired by AlphaGo** \| _Sept. 2023 - Jan. 2024_
* Lead team of four in brainstorming, designing, coding, testing, and presenting our project
* Inspired by game-playing using reinforcement learning, in particular AlphaGo
* Trained a value network using supervised learning and a policy network using reinforcement learning
* Implemented a variant of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) as used in AlphaGo

**MyTorch** \| _August 2023 - Dec.  2023_
* Designing a neural network library from scratch using NumPy
* Applying knowledge of machine learning algorithms to create an object-orientated machine learning library
* Library implements MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GRUs, reverse automatic differentiation, and more

**Speech-to-text transformer** \| _Nov. 2023_
* Implemented and trained encoder-decoder transformer language model
* Inspired by the papers *Attention is All You Need and Listen*, *Attend and Spell*
* Experimented with architectural changes, performed hyperparameter tuning, achieved top Levenshtein distance in class competition
