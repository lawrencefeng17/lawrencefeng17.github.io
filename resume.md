* Minor in Computer Science
* Minor in Mathematics

### Relevant Coursework
---
* Introduction to Deep Learning (11-785, PhD)
* Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Sience (15-251)
* Probablity (21-325)
* Data Structures and Algorithms (15-210)
* Statistical Computing (36-350)

### Projects
---
#### MyTorch
* Appling knowledge of machine learning algorithms to create an object-orientated machine learning library
* Library implements MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GRUs, reverse automatic differentiation, and more.

#### Image Reassembly Using Reinforcement Learning
* Inpisred by AlphaZero. CNNs underlie our architecture, with a supervised learning value network and a reinforcement learning policy netowrk.
* Implemented vanilla policy gradient
* Implemented Monte Carlo tree search with PUCT; value netowrk depth reduction, policy network breadth reduction
* Outperformed previous wors with > 90% solve rate

#### Speech-to-text transformer
* Implemented and trained encoder-decoder transformer language model
* Inspired by the papers Attention is All you Need and Listen, Attend and Spell
* Experimented with architectural changes, performed hyperparameter tuning, achieved top Levenshtein distance in class competition
