### Education
---
### Carnegie Mellon University
_August 2022 - May 2026_

_Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Machine Learning_
_Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania_

* Minor in Computer Science
* Minor in Mathematics

### Relevant Coursework
---
* Introduction to Deep Learning (11-785, PhD)
* Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science (15-251)
* Probability (21-325)
* Data Structures and Algorithms (15-210)
* Statistical Computing (36-350)

### Projects
---
#### MyTorch
_August 2023 - December 2023_
* Appling knowledge of machine learning algorithms to create an object-orientated machine learning library
* Library implements MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GRUs, reverse automatic differentiation, and more.

#### Image Reassembly Using Reinforcement Learning
_September 2023 -_
* Inpisred by AlphaZero. CNNs underlie our architecture, with a supervised learning value network and a reinforcement learning policy netowrk.
* Implemented vanilla policy gradient
* Implemented Monte Carlo tree search with PUCT; value network depth reduction, policy network breadth reduction
* Outperformed previous wors with > 90% solve rate

#### Speech-to-text transformer
* Implemented and trained encoder-decoder transformer language model
* Inspired by the papers Attention is All You Need and Listen, Attend and Spell
* Experimented with architectural changes, performed hyperparameter tuning, achieved top Levenshtein distance in class competition

### Experience
---
### Boston University
_June 2021 - August 2021_
_Research Intern_
* Designed an LSTM cache prefetcher to speed up common computationally intensive tasks
* Applied domain knowledge of computer system design and microarchitecture to a machine-learning task
* Results showed more than a 50% increase in performance compared to no prefetcher in some applications

### UC Berkeley ATDP and Monte Vista
_August 2020 - August 2022_
_Teaching Assistant_
* Acted as the lead teaching assistant for courses in Python and Java
* Developed the curriculum, and helped make and modify assignments to facilitate learning
* Automated evaluation of programming submissions using unit testing
* Streamlined the grading process by using APIs to integrate learning management systems
