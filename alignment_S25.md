### Agenda for 02/07/2025

#### Beginnings (10 minutes)
1. Introductions from Lawrence and Ida! 
2. Some brief guidelines:
    * We won't be doing introductions. Instead, before you speak, state your name. 
    * Please participate!
    * Don't be afraid to ask questions! We're coming from varied backgrounds, so we'll try to make sure we're all on the same page.
    * Have your laptops closed during discussion 
        * Unless you really want to search something up or write something down.
3. How will these reading groups be structured?
    * You don't have to do anything outside these two hours unless you want to!
    * These reading groups will run for approximately 8 weeks (no meetings before finals!)

        * *Week 1*: What is AI, AI safety, and alignment?
        * *Week 2*: Alignment
        * *Week 3*: RLHF and other approaches to alignment
        * *Week 4*: Scalable oversight
