    * Please participate!
    * Don't be afraid to ask questions! We're coming from varied backgrounds, so we'll try to make sure we're all on the same page.
    * Have your laptops closed during discussion 
        * Unless you really want to search something up or write something down.
3. How will these reading groups be structured?
    * You don't have to do anything outside these two hours unless you want to!
